# Alpha - Find It

 Find It is an application that allows users to create unique identifiers for their items and update them with their current contact information in the event that they are lost. People lose their things everyday by leaving them behind or misplacing them. While kind-hearted people might want to help return those items, it often is difficult because there is no way of identifying an owner or trust anyone who says itâ€™s theirs. With Find It, you can always guarantee the ownership of an item because of the unique ID of the item and the verification of an item before you interact with anyone.

## Important Messages

1. If you don't have the correct library installed, you may see dependency errors when running the app. A simple 'pod install' in the folder directory should do the trick. In the event that you don't have the correct libraries installed. Follow these steps:
  - Open terminal and type 'brew install ruby'
  - Then 'sudo gem install cocoapods'
  - And finally 'pod install'
  
2. Firebase offers a storage SDK to upload and download images. It's a time consuming process and we have not yet optimized it. As a result, you will not be able to see your tag's image in the table view when the app loads. WILL BE COMING IN BETA. However, feel free to use the image picker when you add a tag.
