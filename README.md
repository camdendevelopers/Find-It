# Beta - Find It

 Find It is an application that allows users to create unique identifiers for their items and update them with their current contact information in the event that they are lost. People lose their things everyday by leaving them behind or misplacing them. While kind-hearted people might want to help return those items, it often is difficult because there is no way of identifying an owner or trust anyone who says itâ€™s theirs. With Find It, you can always guarantee the ownership of an item because of the unique ID of the item and the verification of an item before you interact with anyone.

## Grading Level
 Same grade for all members

## Differences
 Map view and related functions removed because we thought the added benefit would be minimal and unnecessary. The address from the reporting user should be enough to find the item.

## Important Messages

1. If you don't have the correct library installed, you may see dependency errors when running the app. A simple 'pod install' in the folder directory should do the trick. In the event that you don't have the correct libraries installed. Follow these steps:
  - Open terminal and type 'brew install ruby'
  - Then 'sudo gem install cocoapods'
  - CD to your project folder and type 'pod install'
  
  1.2 In the case that the above steps still do not fix dependency errors, you may be reinstalling pods with your Xcode open or your pods won't allow overwriting. To resolve, try:
  - Deleting the "Pods" folder with your current workspace open
  - Quit Xcode and open terminal
  - CD to your project folder and reinstall pods using 'pod install'
  
2. You can create an account of your own if you like but we have two example accounts with registered items if you would rather use those. Also we recommend you use these users if you want to try the "Reporting functionality"
